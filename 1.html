His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.[1] An important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Bergson, with particular influence derived from Spinoza.<img src="Gilles_Deleuze.png" width="15%"></p>
